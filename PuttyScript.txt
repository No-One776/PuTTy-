Okay, a nice easy & lazy way to use putty and vnc viewer to connect
For you to get putty to open the VNC viewer port connection requires you to load settings
Versus of try to just start one using commands with local and remote ports
so using a saved session you can load & run it....


//-------------First you have to save a putty session with the variables set that you need-----------------

1. In Session -> set the server.address.location 
2. Then go to Connections --> SSH --> Tunnels & set up your ports as normal and add it    (don't click open like normal!)
3. Once you do that, scroll up and go back to Session
4. Save the Session with its own ID such as EOS (for me)


//-------------Create the Batch file/executable script (for those who don't know)--------------------------------------

5. Create a text document per say, on your desktop
6. Put the below text in it (with the modifications for you application)
7. Once you are done..
8. File --> Save as  ---- filename.bat and change the dropdown menu from ".txt" to "all files"
9. and you have a batch script/executeable!

//-------------Here is the script text inside you need!--------------------------------------------------

-----------Version 1 w/ Described steps-----------

@echo off
//------The pass is not required and very lazy & insecure-----
start C:\Users\%Userprofilename%\Desktop\putty.exe "<--Executable Path" -load EOS "<--Session Saved Name" -l username "<--such as rohrj" -pw N00b1sh "<--Very Insecure, working on an encrypted setup"
TIMEOUT 2  "<--You can set this longer to give you time to type in the password"
start C:\Users\%userprofilename%\Desktop\vncviewer.exe "<--Executable Path" localhost "<--What you want VNC viewer to open"

-----------Version 2 /wo descriptive steps-----------

@echo off
start C:\Program Files\putty.exe -load EOS -l rohrj 
TIMEOUT 2
start C:\Program Files\vncviewer.exe localhost

-----------Version 3 w/ Paths set-----------

//----If you have putty and vnc set in your Path environment variables, it can look like this..----

@echo off
start putty.exe -load EOS -l rohrj 
TIMEOUT 2
start vncviewer.exe localhost
